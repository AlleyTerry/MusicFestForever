The Fish King: I saw you in the crowd. You've got star power, kid.
<<JennieMove GameManager>>
Jennie: Me? Really?
<<FishkingMove GameManager>>
The Fish King: As much as people who've got it have it.
The Fish King: Do you dream of stardom, erm...
Jennie: Jennie.
The Fish King: I can make you a star, Jennie.
Jennie: Oh my god, this is my Lizzie McGuire moment!
The Fish King: Oh, sure, yes. This is just like Lozzie Magwyre.
Jennie: Would I need a popstar name? Should I think of one, or does marketing do that?
Jennie: Would we need to focus test it? Is there a theme?
The Fish King: How about... Glitter Glue.
Jennie: What? But she's already a person!
The Fish King: Glitter Glue is... retired.
The Fish King: Permanently.

Tara: We gotta go, Jennie, he's going to eat you-
Jennie: What? This is my big break!
The Fish King: Yes, you nobody, this is her big break!
The Fish King: I'm the Fish King! I run this place! You can't stop me!
The Fish King: Don't ruin this for me-I mean her!
Tara: I have to do something...
Tara: I just have to light this fabric on fire, and...

Tara: Jennie, we gotta go.
Jennie: Tara, what the hell?! He was going to make me a star!
Tara: He was going to <i>eat you</i>.
Jennie: But-
Tara: We have to go, <i>now</i>.
Jennie: This is exactly why I ended things with you! You never want to do anything fun!
Tara: This is not fun!
Tara: This is rainbow capitalism hell!
Tara: I've spent the whole day trying to take care of you, looking for you.
Tara: I just molotov'd that weird fish guy for you!
Jennie: You're right, I'm sorry I said that. It's been really fun hanging out as friends today.
Tara: I don't want to be friends with you, Jennie.
Tara: I want us to leave this place, alive, and then never speak again.
Tara: If you have ever cared about me at all, you'll leave with me right now.
Jennie: You're so hot when you're bossy.
Tara: Not now, Jennie.
